## Roadmap

Missing, sorted by priority:

- [ ] Support for installing app bundle (A).
- [ ] Analyze apk metainfo (name, version, package, etc.) (B).
- [ ] Sign-in apk (C).

Keep in mind that this is not a file manager. I have plans to make it a 'file explorer' app in the future, but for now, the main feature is just to extract apks.
